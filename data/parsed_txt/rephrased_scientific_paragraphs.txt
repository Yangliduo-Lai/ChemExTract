STEP 9: YIELD a 1:1 mixture of diastereomers as a foam (2.2 g, 69% yield).
STEP 10: ADD 1.2 mL methanol and 14 ml water, let it stand overnight, then dilute with 70 ml water.
STEP 11: EXTRACT three times using 84 mL Methyl-tert-butylether.
STEP 12: CONCENTRATE the mixture.
STEP 13: DISSOLVE in MeOH.
STEP 14: PURIFY by sulfonic acid solid phase extraction. 
STEP 15: WASH column with MeOH.
STEP 16: ELUTE using a 10% NH3/MeOH solution to give the free base of the product.
STEP 17: PURIFY the product by high performance liquid chromatography and combine the required fractions.
STEP 18: ADD K2CO3 (0.5 g) and EXTRACT with DCM.
STEP 19: DRY and REMOVE the solvent in vacuum to yield a yellow solid.
STEP 20: HEAT the mixture at 90°C and maintain at this temperature overnight.
STEP 21: ADD water and EXTRACT with ethyl acetate.
STEP 22: WASH the combined organic layers with saturated brine.
STEP 23: DRY over anhydrous Na2SO4.
STEP 24: REMOVE the solvent in vacuum.

STEP 26: STIR the mixture in the ice bath for 10 min then at room temperature for 20 min.
STEP 27: REMOVE the desiccant and solvent.
STEP 28: Purify by chromatography using varying proportions of DCM/isopropanol.
STEP 29: MAINTAIN a temperature below 30°C.
STEP 30: ADD 18.1 ml (18 mmol) of a 1-molar solution of boron tribromide in dichloromethane to a solution of 4-chloro-3-(2,3-dichloro-4-methoxybenzyl)-5-difluoromethoxy-1-methyl-1H-pyrazole which had been cooled to −78°C.
STEP 31: REFINE as per Example 153B using 2,3-dichlorophenylisothiocyanate and the product of Example 203A.
STEP 32: WASH the combined organic layer with saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate and brine after extraction.
STEP 33: STIR (7-Fluoro-2-oxo-1,5-naphthyridin-1(2H)-yl)acetaldehyde methyl hemiacetal and 1,1-dimethylethyl[(3S,4R)-3-hydroxy-4-piperidinyl]carbamate in chloroform plus methanol under argon.
