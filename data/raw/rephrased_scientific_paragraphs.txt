Step1:
DISSOLVE Ba (9.5 mmol), La (0.5 mmol) acetates and Fe nitrate (10 mmol) in water (100 mL)

Step2:
COMBINE the mixed metal salt solution and ethanol (100 mL) containing oxalic acid (90 mmol)

Step3:
ALLOW the yellow-colored suspension to stand for 1 h

Step4:
FILTER the suspension to collect the precursor metal oxalate particles

Step5:
DRY the obtained precursor powder at 120 degC for 2 h

Step6:
CALCINE the dried precursor powder at 700 degC for 2 h

Step7:
PRESS-FORM the calcined powder into a disk to form a green porous support disk

Step8:
PREPARE the BLF powder as the precursor of a dense layer by an Aqueous Melt Polymerization (AMP) method

Step9:
ADD an aqueous malic acid solution (50 mL) to a solution (50 mL) containing the corresponding metal nitrates or acetates in a stoichiometric ratio under vigorous stirring. 

Step10:
STIR the mixture vigorously. 

Note:
The use of ethanol in step 2 is critical to the precipitation of the metal oxalates.
