DISSOLVE Ba acetate (9.5 mmol), La acetate (0.5 mmol), and Fe nitrate (10 mmol) in water (100 mL)
ADD the mixed metal salt solution to ethanol (100 mL) with oxalic acid (90 mmol) to make a yellow suspension
ALLOW the suspension to stand for 1 hour
FILTRATE the suspension to collect the precursor metal oxalate particles
DRY the obtained precursor powder at 120 degC for 2 hours
CALCINATE the dried powder at 700 degC for 2 hours
PRESS-FORM the calcinated powder into a disc to make a green porous support disc
PREPARE a BLF powder - the precursor of a dense layer - using the AMP method
ADD an aqueous malic acid solution (50 mL) to a solution (50 mL) that contains corresponding metal nitrates or acetates in a stoichiometric ratio under strong stirring.
