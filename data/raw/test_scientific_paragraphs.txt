 porous BLF support was fabrin the presence of Bu3P ( 10 mol % ) in DMF at room temperature for 48 h aï¬€orded the (E)-3-methyleneisoindolin-1- one 4a in the yield of 42 % accomol) and La (0.5 mmol) acetates and Fe nitrate (10 mmol) were first dissolved in water (100 mL). The mixed metal salt solution was then added to ethanol (100 mL) containing oxalic acid (90 mmol). The mixing produced a yellow-colored suspension, which was allowed to stand for 1 h. The use of ethanol was critical to the precipitation of the metal oxalates. The suspension was filtrated to collect the precursor metal oxalate particles. The obtained precursor powder was dried at 120 degC for 2 h and then calcined at 700 degC for 2 h. The calcined powder was press-formed into a disk to form a green porous support disk. A BLF powder as the precursor of a dense layer was prepared by an AMP method 31. An aqueous malic acid solution (50 mL) was added to a solution (50 mL) containing the corresponding metal nitrates or acetates in a stoichiometric ratio under vigorous stirring.
