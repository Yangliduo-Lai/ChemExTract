DISSOLVE Ba acetate (9.5 mmol), La acetate (0.5 mmol), and Fe nitrate (10 mmol) in water (100 mL)
ADD the mixed metal salt solution to ethanol (100 ml) with oxalic acid (90 mmol) to make a yellow suspension
LET the suspension stand for 1 hour
FILTER the suspension to collect the precipitated metal oxalate precursor
DRY the precursor at 120°C for 2 hours
CALCINE the dried powder at 700°C for 2 hours
PRESS the calcinated powder into a disc to obtain a green porous support
SYNTHESIZE BLF powder as dense layer precursor using the AMP method
MIX an aqueous malic acid solution (50 mL) with a metal nitrate or acetate solution (50 mL) in stoichiometric ratio under vigorous stirring
